However, most causal knowledge is locked away in unstructured text data like articles on the web. Deep learning models are getting better at extracting relationships from text, but typically don’t account for the uncertainty in the relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur team is developing a semi-supervised method for creating large scale causal knowledge graphs that account for relation uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Causality?\r\n\r\nDeep learning models can perform well on complex tasks, but are often black boxes. In our recently submitted paper, “What Causes Causality? Explaining a Deep Causal Text Detection Model”, we investigate which words are most important to such a model in order to better understand its decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe produced saliency maps of word importance in causal sentences from CauseNet. A few examples are shown below. By investigating these plots, we found that the causal detection model broadly consider causal phrases, effect phrases and connective as important. In addition, the causal detection model exhibited a greedy property where multiple causal phrases in a single sentence were considered important, when only one would have been needed. We hope our results will inform the development of future causal extraction model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
